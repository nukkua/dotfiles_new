Native [Warp terminal](https://www.warp.dev/) toasts for [Pi Agent](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono) lifecycle events. When Pi finishes a long task, asks for your input, or completes a turn, `rpiv-warp` emits Warp's `OSC 777` escape sequence and Warp surfaces a native OS notification. Outside Warp it does nothing - install it everywhere, it only fires where it's useful.

## Features

- **Native OS toasts on Pi lifecycle events** - agent start, agent end, blocking-tool calls, and turn boundaries surface as native Warp / macOS / Windows notifications.
- **Live Warp tab badge** - the tab indicator transitions through **In progress → Success / Blocked** as Pi works.
- **Tab-title spinner** - animates the tab title while the agent loop is active and restores Pi's `π - <repo>` title on stop.
- **Configurable blocking-tool allowlist** - choose which tool calls flip the badge to **Blocked** via `~/.config/rpiv-warp/config.json`. Defaults to `ask_user_question`.
- **Startup-only session notifications** - `/new`, `/resume`, `/fork`, and `/reload` stay quiet; only fresh startups notify.
- **Silent outside Warp** - no-op when not running in Warp, on known-broken Warp builds, or when `/dev/tty` is unreachable.
- **Windows support** - best-effort delivery via `process.stdout` / ConPTY, gated on `isTTY`.
- **Zero-tool, zero-UI footprint** - no tools registered with the model, no commands, no widgets, no token cost.

## Install

```bash
pi install npm:@juicesharp/rpiv-warp
```

`rpiv-warp` is **opt-in** - it is NOT auto-installed by `/rpiv-setup`. Install it explicitly only if you use Warp.

## What you get

| Pi event | Warp wire event | Effect on the tab badge |
|---|---|---|
| `session_start` (startup only) | `session_start` | records plugin version |
| `agent_start` | `prompt_submit` | → **In progress** |
| `agent_end` | `stop` | → **Success** (checkmark) |
| `tool_call` (configured blocking tool) | `question_asked` | → **Blocked** ("Waiting for your answer") |
| `tool_execution_end` (configured blocking tool) | `tool_complete` | Blocked → **In progress** |

`session_start` is filtered to `reason === "startup"` only - `/new`, `/resume`, `/fork`, `/reload` do NOT emit (you're already looking at the terminal in those cases).

## Config

Optional file at `~/.config/rpiv-warp/config.json`:

```json
{
  "blockingTools": ["ask_user_question", "my_custom_blocking_tool"]
}
```

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `blockingTools` | `["ask_user_question"]` | Tool names that put the Warp tab badge into the **Blocked** state when called and clear it when the tool finishes. Use for tools that genuinely block the agent loop on user input. |

Missing or malformed file falls back to defaults - no config required.

## Detection

`rpiv-warp` reads three environment variables Warp sets automatically:

- `TERM_PROGRAM === "WarpTerminal"` - required. Outside Warp the extension is a no-op.
- `WARP_CLI_AGENT_PROTOCOL_VERSION` - required for structured emission. If unset, `rpiv-warp` does nothing rather than falling back to a less-rich legacy format.
- `WARP_CLIENT_VERSION` - used for broken-version gating. A short list of known-broken Warp builds (per release channel) suppresses emission until Warp ships a fix.

## Edge cases

| Case | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Not in Warp (`TERM_PROGRAM !== "WarpTerminal"`) | Silent no-op - extension loads, every handler short-circuits |
| Pi in print mode (`pi -p "..."`) | **Toasts still fire** - print mode emits all four events at the agent layer |
| `/dev/tty` unreachable (cron, no-tty SSH) | Silent no-op - `try/catch` around `openSync` |
| Windows | Best-effort - writes OSC 777 to `process.stdout` so ConPTY forwards it to Warp ([Warp eng blog: "ConPTY will send even unrecognized OSCs to the shell"](https://www.warp.dev/blog/building-warp-on-windows)). Skipped when stdout is not a TTY (piped/redirected output). Untested in the wild - no Warp plugin currently ships a Windows transport |
| Known-broken Warp build | Silent no-op - broken-version table gates emission per channel |

## Why standalone (not a sibling)

`rpiv-warp` is intentionally NOT registered in `rpiv-pi`'s sibling list. Not every Pi user uses Warp - auto-installing it everywhere would impose Warp-specific code on every install. If you don't use Warp, don't install it. If you do, install it explicitly. The package still joins the rpiv-mono lockstep version + shared release pipeline.
